## Reflection Questions

1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.
   No outside resources were used to complete my submission.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words)
   The biggest challenge was applying the logic to the game using Javascript. This is what I consider the project that really involved software
   development concepts. Fortunately the instructions laid out were very helpful in completing this task.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   As of right now my biggest question is how to work more with data. I'm glad I have been able to be exposed to the front end side of
   a project. But I am also very interested into the back-end as well. In particular how data is stored and called.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
   If a had more time to be able to spend on this project I would definitely add more features. Perhaps a feature that keeps track of a high score.
   Another feature could be to add animation the lights of the buttons when the page starts up.
